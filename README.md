# etch-a-sketch

This is a odin project to help me practice DOM manipulation and java script coding. 
The etch a sketch project is a website that consists of many small boxes in which
the user can etch in with the hovering of their mouse. The user can also choose
how many boxes they want, up to 100, and can draw in any of them with their cursor.
